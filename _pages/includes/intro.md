I am currently a second-year Ph.D. student supervised by [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/nwpuzhanglei.html) at [ASGO](https://asgo.nwpu.edu.cn/), in the School of Computer Science, Northwestern Polytechnical University, Xi'an, China. I am broadly interested in computer vision, with a focus on generative AI.

Prior to my Ph.D. study, I obtained my M.S. degree in Computer Technology in 2024 at Northwestern Polytechnical University from the School of Computer Science at Northwestern Polytechnical University, advised by [Prof. Lei Zhang](https://teacher.nwpu.edu.cn/nwpuzhanglei.html). Before this, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computer Science and Technology from the School of Information Science and Engineering at Yanshan University, Qinhuangdao, China in 2021.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me via [Email](mailto:wanghaoyunwpu@mail.nwpu.edu.cn)
